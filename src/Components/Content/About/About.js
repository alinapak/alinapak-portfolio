         <div className="container"> Hello. I'm Alina, and I'm a web developer. In short, I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Psychology in 2014. A year and a half ago, I transitioned to become a PHP Developer at the Baltic Institute of Technology, transforming into a 'freshly baked' web developer. Following my training, I promptly secured a position at a startup company, where I further honed my skills and expertise in web development. </div>
